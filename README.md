# freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects
## Build a Product Landing Page

I built this front-end page to complete the freeCodeCamp assignment [Build a Technical Document](hhttps://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page) in the Responsive Web Design certification.

I've been a fan of [The SeaMonkey Project](https://www.seamonkey-project.org/) since it came pre-installed with LXLE, the distro I installed on my first Linux laptop. Content is used with their permission.

The formal assignment is submitted in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ewotawa/full/ExKgRBq).
